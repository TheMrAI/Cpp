# Containers

Containers are the backbone of any application, well except for data
oriented designs, but that is it's own black magic in itself. In this
regard they are "simple" for the onlooker and exceedingly complicated
inside. The proves and engineering knowledge that went into developing
them and implementing them in Cpp is underappreciated. This is a good
thing as it means they work well enough that one does not need to concern
themselves with their usage. It is bad as there is much and more that can
be learned from them in terms of making design decisions and
implementing them.
