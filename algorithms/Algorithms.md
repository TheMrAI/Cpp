# Algorithms

There are hundreds of algorithms out there. Each more complicated than the
last. However the most basic ones, that are most commonly used are getting
hard to find. Claims about the performance of each algorithm are going
around the internet, but rarely can someone see them being compared in
action. To rectify this and to collect and preserve the essence of each
algorithm, this sub section was made.
