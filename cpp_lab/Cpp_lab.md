# Cpp laboratory

This part of the repository is the least useful for most, as the solutions, here don't come with the questions.

In any case the contents within and the professor maintaining the course
made a great impression on me. Highlighting the importance of understanding
the inner workings of Cpp.

The course page: [Cpp11](https://cpp11.eet.bme.hu/)

My great professor: No name

Sorry for the letdown. My professor is happy being appreciated  without
being thanked. :)
I do wish I can convince him one day to write a book though.

All the solutions to his laboratory problems are here with his permission,
for which I am thankful!
